      <h1>Swaminarayan — Saints (Sants / Nand Saints)</h1>

      <h2>Who are the Saints?</h2>
      <p>
        When Swaminarayan Bhagwan established the Sampraday, He ordained nearly 3000 ascetic saints — collectively known as the “Nand Saints.” :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
        These saints came from diverse backgrounds — scholars, simple farmers, young bachelors, people with families — but upon meeting Swaminarayan Bhagwan, they renounced material life and dedicated themselves wholly to spiritual service. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>

      <h2>Vows (Five-fold Discipline)</h2>
      <p>All Nand Saints adhered strictly to five core vows (Panch-Vartman):</p>
      <ul class="vows-list">
        <li><strong>Nishkam</strong>: Complete abstinence from women. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>
        <li><strong>Nirlobh</strong>: Free from all wealth and greed. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</li>
        <li><strong>Nirman</strong>: Dispose of ego and pride; humbly surrender to God. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}</li>
        <li><strong>Niswad</strong>: Transcend desire for taste (food/drink). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}</li>
        <li><strong>Ni­s-sneh</strong>: Detach from material relationships and possessions. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Role & Contributions of the Saints</      >
      <ul>
        <li>They travelled across remote villages to spread satsang and introduce devotees to the teachings of Swaminarayan Bhagwan. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}</li>
        <li>They authored scriptures, composed kirtans, and preserved the spiritual heritage for future generations. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}</li>
        <li>They established and maintained temples, making devotional worship accessible to common people throughout regions. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}</li>
        <li>Through their steadfast devotion and sacrifices, they laid the foundations upon which the Swaminarayan Sampraday grew and flourished. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Some Prominent Saints</h2>
      <p>
        The tradition remembers many saints by name. Some of the important ones include:

      <h2>Legacy of the Saints</h2>
      <p>
        Thanks to their renunciation, penance, and tireless efforts, the sampraday was able to reach remote corners — spreading devotion, establishing temples, imparting scriptural wisdom, and uplifting social standards. Their legacy continues to inspire devotees even today. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
