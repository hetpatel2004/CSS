      <h2>Major Temples (Mandirs) of the Sampraday</h2>
      <p>The following temples were constructed during the lifetime of Swaminarayan Bhagwan — these form the historic core of the Sampraday’s mandir-network. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</p>

      <ul class="temple-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Ahmedabad (Kalupur) — Shri Nar Narayan Dev Mandir:</strong>
          The first temple of the Sampraday, constructed 1822; built from Burma-teak wood with detailed wood-carving; dedicated to Nar-Narayan Dev. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bhuj — Shri Nar Narayan Dev Mandir:</strong>

          <strong>Junagadh — Shri Radha-Raman / Ranchhodrai Dev Mandir:</strong>

          <strong>Gadhada — Shri Gopinathji Maharaj Mandir:</strong>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Purpose & Significance of These Mandirs</h3>
      <p>
        According to Sampraday history, these six temples were built so devotees could worship God in a fixed, sanctified place — to ensure the continuity of upasana (devotion) even after the Lord’s departure. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
      </p>

      <h3>Wider Sampraday & Modern Mandirs</h3>
      <p>
        Over time, the Sampraday’s sphere expanded — new mandirs (both “Hari-mandirs” and “Shikharbaddha” type temples) were built by various branches and organizations under the Swaminarayan tradition, to serve devotees across Gujarat, India, and worldwide. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
