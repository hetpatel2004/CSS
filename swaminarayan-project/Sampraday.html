      <h1>Swaminarayan Sampraday</h1>

      <h2>Origin of the Swaminarayan Sect</h2>
      <p>
        The Swaminarayan Sampradaya, earlier known as the Uddhav Sampraday, was established by
        Param Pujya Sadguru Shri Ramanand Swami. Ramanand Swami is believed to be the incarnation
        of Uddhavji — a close disciple of Lord Shri Krishna — and he spread spiritual knowledge in
        Saurashtra in the late 1700s.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was initiated by Aatmanand Swami, but because their beliefs differed, Ramanand Swami
        continued seeking true spiritual knowledge. During his travels, he studied the texts of
        Shri Ramanujacharya and accepted the principles of Vishishtadvaita philosophy.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Srirangam, he received a divine vision in which Shri Ramanujacharya blessed and initiated
        him into the spiritual lineage. Later, in Vrindavan, he received the divine darshan of
        Lord Shri Krishna and was guided to continue spreading dharma.
      </p>

      <h2>Arrival of Nilkanth Varni</h2>
      <p>
        Years later, Nilkanth Varni (the young form of Bhagwan Swaminarayan) met Ramanand Swami.
        On 20 October 1800, Ramanand Swami initiated Nilkanth Varni into the sadhu-fold as
        “Sahajanand Swami.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly before passing away, Ramanand Swami appointed Sahajanand Swami as his successor and
        head of the Sampraday. From this moment onward, the Uddhav Sampradaya became known as the
        Swaminarayan Sampradaya.
      </p>

      <h2>Philosophy of the Sampraday (Vishishtadvaita)</h2>
      <p>The Sampraday accepts five eternal realities:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jiva:</strong> Souls bound by Maya.</li>
        <li><strong>Ishwar:</strong> Higher souls who govern the universe.</li>
        <li><strong>Maya:</strong> The eternal power responsible for material existence.</li>
        <li><strong>Brahm:</strong> The eternally liberated form of the soul.</li>
        <li><strong>Parabrahm:</strong> The supreme God — Purushottam Narayan (Swaminarayan Bhagwan).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This philosophy, inherited from Vishishtadvaita but clarified further, forms the foundation
        of Swaminarayan dharma.
      </p>

      <h2>Divine Role of Sahajanand Swami</h2>
      <p>
        Sahajanand Swami revealed his true identity as Swaminarayan Bhagwan and guided thousands
        toward salvation. He established strict moral codes, emphasized devotion to God, and
        uplifted society spiritually, socially, and culturally.
      </p>
